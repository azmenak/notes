Marketing Strategy
==================

## Porters 5 Forces
- So basically these are kinda useless and won't be used in the real world ever
- Use it to determin the average profiltabilty of the industry

In the context of competitive advantage, how does a company acheive better profits?

We talked about the airline industry, from that I got that they need to manage their capacity to stay competitive

## Case: _Le Chateux_
- We talked about DuPont analysis
    + breaks down ROE into three parts (google it)
- Why does CTU.A use ROA all over the place?
    + slightly more representative

### Debt is cheaper then equity?
- Ownership is paid in perpetuity
- Better based on the timeframe for repaying the debt
    + Long term: ownership can be better
    + Short term: debt can be better

## Baics
- he doesn't care about the new ad program :(
- what is their marketing stragegy
    + how do they compete
    + who do they compete with etc.
    
## Current positions
- ROA is down
    + Sales are around the same
    + Selling at a discount => the margins are going down
        * Profits are down

### Why are the sales down?
- lots of excuses...
    + weather, market, etc.
- seems like people don't want to pay for their shit
- DR is telling us their strategy is terrible `=> true`

### Issues raising money 
- Jane (CEO) put $5 million into the company 
- Husband had put in $10 million 5 years ago
- `ACID: 0.2` and `Current: 1.6`

### Unbundling
- Vertical integrations used to be an advantage
- Limits global economies of scale
- Used the byte _econonmies of scope_

## Competitive Advantage

### Notes on MarketStrat
Getting a product into a new market
- Mo. money
- R&D, lots of R&D
    + balance existing markets and R&D spend

### Porter: "What is Strategy"
- Operational efficiency is neccessary but not sufficient 
- Unique and valuable position
- Set of companies activities
